# mern_skeleton_frontend

The topics covered are:

* Frontend features of the skeleton

* Setting up development with React, React Router and Material-UI

* Rendering a home page built with React

* Backend user API integration

* Auth integration for restricted access

* User list, profile, edit, delete, sign up, and sign in UI to complete the user frontend

* Basic server-side rendering

## Defining the skeleton application frontend

We will add the following **user interface components** to our base aplication:

* Home page: A view that renders at the **root URL** to welcome users to the web application.

* Sign-up page: A view with a form for **user sign-up**, allowing new users to create a user account and redirecting them to a sign-in page when successfully created.
